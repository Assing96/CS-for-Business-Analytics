# Scalable Product Duplicate Detection 
> The number of Web shops has grown rapidly over the past decades and a great variety of products has been available online. However, different Web shops use different representations for the same product. Hence, it can be very time consuming for customers to find their most preferred product for the best combination of price and specifications. It is greatly beneficial for consumers if data  from  different 
Web  shops  could  be  aggregated  to  form  a  more  complete  set  of  product  information. To  automatically  aggregate  data  from  various  Web 
sites,  it is necessary to perform duplicate detection. Due to the ever increasing size of the data,  the  scalability issue for duplicate product detection must be adressed. In this project, a scalability solution for the involved computations by reducing the number of comparisons using Locality Sensitive  Hashing (LSH) in combination with Hierarchical clustering is proposed for finding duplicates. The python codes for this project can be found in the ComputerSciencePaper.py file. In this readme, a simple explantion to the structure of the code will be given. And a brief guide on how to effectively use the code with some screenshots from the results if the code has ran properly.

## Code structure
The code is divided into 4 sections each section separated with a section number and dash line. An example is: 
" # Section 2-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

- In Section 1 of the code, the data is imported and cleaned to increase the effectiveness of the algorithm. The cleaning procedure is explained under methods in the paper.
- In Section 2 of the code, all the neccessary methods and function is created. The core methods to look for are `binaryMatrix`, `minHashing`, `LSH` and `Replicate`. The clustering algorithm is used under `Replicate`.
